                                            Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body to restore energy flow and balance. Some studies suggest that acupuncture may have a positive impact on mood disorders by influencing neurotransmitter levels, reducing stress hormones, and promoting relaxation. However, more research is needed to fully understand its effectiveness in treating mood disorders.

                                            Nature therapy involves spending time in natural environments, such as parks, forests, or gardens, to improve mental well-being and reduce stress. Research suggests that exposure to nature can lower cortisol levels (the stress hormone), enhance mood, and promote relaxation. Activities like nature walks, gardening, or simply enjoying outdoor settings can be beneficial for managing stress and preventing burnout.
